    <h1 align="center">1. HTML â€“ OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language,</b> and it is the most widely used language to
        write Web Pages.<br>
        <b><u>Hypertext</u></b> refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked
        together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.<br>
        As its name suggests, HTML is a <b>Markup Language</b> which means you use HTML to
        simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure
        it to display.<br>
        Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like
        headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information
        between researchers.<br>
        Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available
        in HTML language.</p>

            editor. Finally open it using a web browser like Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, or Firefox
            etc. It must show the following output:</h3></p>
