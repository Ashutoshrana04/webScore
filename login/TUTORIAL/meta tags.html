    <h1 align="center">7. HTML â€“ META TAGS </h1>
    <p><h3>HTML lets you specify metadata - additional important information about a document in a
        variety of ways. The META elements can be used to include name/value pairs describing
        properties of the HTML document, such as author, expiry date, a list of keywords, document
        author etc.
        The <meta> tag is used to provide such additional information. This tag is an empty element
        and so does not have a closing tag but it carries information within its attributes.
        You can include one or more meta tags in your document based on what information you
        want to keep in your document but in general, meta tags do not impact physical appearance
        of the document so from appearance point of view, it does not matter if you include them or
        not.</h3></p>

            document which is represented by HEAD and /HEAD tags. A meta tag can have
