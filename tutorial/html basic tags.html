  <h2>Heading Tags</h2><hr>
  <p><h4>Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also
    has six levels of headings, which use the elements.<b>h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6.</b>. While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that
    heading.</h4>

    <h1>Paragraph Tag</h1><hr>
    <p>The P tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of
        text should go in between an opening P and a closing /P tag as shown below in the
        example:</p>
        <h2>Example</h2><hr>

        <h1>Line Break Tag</h1><hr>
        <p><h4>Whenever you use the br/ element, anything following it starts from the next line. This
            tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as
            there is nothing to go in between them.
            The br/ tag has a space between the characters br and the forward slash. If you omit this
            space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you miss the forward
            slash character and just use br it is not valid in XHTML.</h4></p>

            <h1>Horizontal Lines</h1><hr>
            <p><h3>Horizontal lines are used to visual break-up sections of a document. The hr tag creates
                a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks the line
                accordingly.
                For example, you may want to give a line between two paragraphs as in the given example
                below:</h3></p>
