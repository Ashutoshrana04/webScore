    <h1>4. HTML â€“ ATTRIBUTES</h1><hr>
    <p><h3>We have seen few HTML tags and their usage like heading tags h1, h2, paragraph tag
        <p> and other tags. We used them so far in their simplest form, but most of the HTML tags
        can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information.<pre>
        *An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the
        element's opening tag. All attributes are made up of two parts: a name and a value:
        *The name is the property you want to set. For example, the paragraph p element
        in the example carries an attribute whose name is align, which you can use to indicate
        the alignment of paragraph on the page.</pre>
        
        The value is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within
        quotations. The below example shows three possible values of align attribute: left,
        center and right.
        Attribute names and attribute values are case-insensitive. However, the World Wide Web
        Consortium (W3C) recommends lowercase attributes/attribute values in their HTML 4
        recommendation.</h3></p>
